I have been using a MAC computer and have not tested codes in Other Environments. To run codes, the folder location needs to be changed in the file: "FileHandler.cs", line 10. 
i.e, static string[] locationFolders = new string[6] { "Documents", "Lexicon", "Checkpoint", "Checkpoint2", "Data", "DataFile.txt" };
